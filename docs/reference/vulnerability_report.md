# Vulnerability Report
A Vulnerability Report is a structure describing a specific manifest, its
contents, and the vulnerabilities affecting its contents.

{{# godoc claircore.VulnerabilityReport}}

A Vulnerability Report is package focused.

Unpacking a report is done by mapping the keys in the PackageVulnerabilities
field to the data structures in other lookup maps.

For example:

```go
{{#include ../vulnerabilityreport_test.go:example}}
```
